# Music Tags Dataset ðŸŽ¶

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of song data, including tags and metadata, for tracks spanning from the 2000s to the present day. The tags were extracted using the **Last.fm API** and **Genius Web Scraping**, making this dataset a valuable resource for music analysis, recommendation systems, or any project related to music and its metadata.

## Datasets Overview
### 1. **Genius Metadata**  
These files contain metadata related to **Genius-specific tags**. Genius tags are often based on lyrics and themes, such as mood, genre, and other descriptive tags.

- `genius_metadata.zip`  
  Contains the first part of the Genius tags dataset for various songs.
- `genius_metadata_2.zip`  
  Contains the second part of the Genius tags dataset, complementing `genius_metadata.zip`.

### 2. **Last.fm Metadata**  
These files contain **Last.fm-specific tags**. Last.fm tags are user-generated and are based on listening behavior, genre, and other user-generated content.

- `lastfm_metadata.zip`  
  Contains the first part of the Last.fm tags dataset for various songs.
- `lastfm_metadata_2.zip`  
  Contains the second part of the Last.fm tags dataset, complementing `lastfm_metadata.zip`.
- `lastfm_metadata_3.zip`  
  Contains the third part of the Last.fm tags dataset, further extending the metadata from the previous two files.

### 3. **Merged Last.fm and Genius Metadata**  
These files contain songs for which both **Last.fm** and **Genius** tags have been extracted. This group includes entries that have data from both sources, making it easier to analyze songs with both sets of tags.

- `lastfm_genius_metadata.zip`  
  Contains the first part of the dataset where both Last.fm and Genius tags are available for the same songs.
- `lastfm_genius_metadata_2.zip`  
  Contains the second part of the dataset, complementing `lastfm_genius_metadata.zip` with additional songs that have both Last.fm and Genius tags.

## Song Datasets Used
This repository utilizes the following song datasets, which are sourced from Kaggle. These datasets provide metadata about songs, including attributes like artist, song title, genre, and other audio features. Below are the details of each dataset:

### 1. **[Spotify 12M Songs](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rodolfofigueroa/spotify-12m-songs)**  
This dataset contains data for 12 million songs on Spotify. It includes various attributes related to the tracks, such as:
- **Artist**: The artist of the song.
- **Song Title**: The name of the track.
- **Genre**: The genre(s) associated with the track.
- **Audio Features**: Includes attributes like danceability, energy, key, loudness, and more.

This large-scale dataset is ideal for analyzing song features, building recommendation systems, and conducting audio analysis.

### 2. **[Spotify 1 Million Tracks](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitanshjoshi/spotify-1million-tracks)**  
This dataset contains 1 million tracks from Spotify. Key attributes include:
- **Artist**: The name of the artist.
- **Song Title**: The title of the song.
- **Audio Features**: This includes attributes like acousticness, instrumentalness, tempo, and more.
- **Popularity**: A score indicating the popularity of the song based on Spotifyâ€™s data.

This dataset is more compact than the 12M dataset but still provides a wealth of information for music data analysis and feature engineering.
